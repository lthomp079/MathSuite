# MathSuite
I just had an idea to come up with a big suite, made in C++ of math tools. Pretty simple, but hopefully someone can help me with it?

# How to Download
I will be able to compile this to be able to work on Windows, and Linux. If someone knows how to get this working on Mac, please let me know, because I don't know how!
Please wait for the Downloads for Linux and Windows, otherwise you can just compile the code on your own!
